# Understanding Superpositition via auditory simulations

This program is intended to allow the user to enter a specific number of outcomes for a quantum state. 
Each outcome is represented by a frequency (a sinusoidal wave), starting at 600 Hz and incrementing by 50 Hz (this setting is adjustable).
There are three total graphs, one for the plots of the frequency waves and the sum of them, one for the fast-Fourier-transform of the waves, and one for a spectrogram of the waves.
At the top lies the superposition equation custom-made for the given quantum state.

The purpose of this program is to give new ways to understand superposition, and to simulate it in seperate 
senses. Additionally, this program gives new insight to quantum physics and superposition, by demonstrating
how when decomposing superposition into sinusoidal waves, it derives a Fourier transform.
